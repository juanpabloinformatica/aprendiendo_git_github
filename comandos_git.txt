git and github

-1 inside the folder -> git init
-2 check status -> git status -s
-3 first modificatin -> git add .
-4 second modification (box signature) -> git commit -m "message body"
-5 to look for boxes previously created ->  git log --oneline

if appears vim editor -> press :q!

if you want to check user config -> git config user.email or git config user.name

6 - introducing github
	6.1
	create a new repository
	6.2
	if you had had done some git things, you can follow 
	the second instructions.
	are the following:
	......
	6.3
	put credentials

7 - if you want to check url of github repository -> git remote -v
8 - for ignoring files or folders , it has to be created a .gitignore file
insidi this , we write the elements to be ignored.
9- travelling through time
	9.1 - use git log --oneline
		then git checkout {id} to
		to see what was happening in that moment
		with your project
10 - to rename branch name -> git branch -m oldbranchname newbranchname
11 - putting main instead of master as global -> git config --global init.defaultBranch main
12 - you can go back with git reset --mixed {id}
	this instruction delete temporaly the commits which are after
	the one we are now, however if we did not modified the files,
	we can go back and situate in the same point we were before, it means ahead.

13- use better git revert instead of git reset 
because the second one can give us problems with github

14 - navigating through branches-> git checkout {branchname}  

15 - merge branches , once situed in the branch to update, 
	git merge {branchname}

16 - removing something done but without been commited -> git checkout -- filename
								git checkout -- .
